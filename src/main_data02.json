        "main_para": "A partnership firm is a type of business entity where two or more people join together to carry on a business to earn profits. Each partner contributes capital, skills, and expertise to the partnership and shares in the profits and losses of the business. The terms and conditions of the partnership are typically laid out in a partnership agreement. In India, partnership firms are governed by the Indian Partnership Act, of 1932. A partnership firm is not a separate legal entity from its partners, which means that the partners are personally liable for the debts and obligations of the business. Partnerships can be classified as either general partnerships or limited partnerships. In a general partnership, all partners have unlimited liability and are responsible for the debts and obligations of the business. In a limited partnership, there are one or more partners with limited liability who are not actively involved in the management of the business. Partnerships are commonly used in professional services such as law firms, accounting firms, and consulting firms. They can also be used in other industries where two or more individuals wish to join together to start a business. Partnership firms are relatively easy to form and operate and provide a flexible structure for the partners to manage and grow the business together."
